# Drawio-rs

Crate for drawing graphics using `Draw.io`.

## Installation

First install `Drawio.io` locally on your computer and make it available from terminal.

### Native Windows

- Install the program [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/).
- Add to path for the shell you use, e.g., in PowerShell `$Env:Path += ';<PATH>`, where `<PATH>` is the full path to the folder where the `draw.io.exe` is stored - in the case of a system wide install:
  
  ```shell
  $Env:Path += ';C:\Program Files\draw.io'
  ```

### Linux, Osx and Windows WSL

- Install `draw.io` using your package manager, should be in path by default.

## Use

- `.drawio` files are stored in the `xml` folder.
- The `draw.io` program can be used to view/edit `.drawio` files. It can also be used to export in `pdf`, `svg` etc. This is also possible in batch (command line) mode, e.g., a (cropped) `pdf` is generated by:

  ```shell
  draw.io -x -f pdf -o out.pdf --crop .\xml\out.drawio
  ```
  
  Batching will eventually be supported by the library but for now you can run the command in a shell.
